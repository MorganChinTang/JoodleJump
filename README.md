# Joodle Jump  

Joodle Jump is a simplified spinoff of the classic **Doodle Jump**, reimagined as my very first attempt at making a mobile game using **Unity**. In this game, you control a character by pressing **left and right buttons** on the screen to move accordingly. The goal is simple: **Reach as far as you can!**

## ðŸ“± Gameplay
- **Controls:**  
  - Tap the **Left Button** to move left.  
  - Tap the **Right Button** to move right.  
- **Objective:**  
  - Keep climbing higher and higher without falling.  
  - Challenge yourself to beat your previous high scores!  

## ðŸ’¡ About the Project
This is my first attempt at creating a mobile game, and I'm learning a lot along the way. While I have some experience making PC games, the mobile platform presents unique challenges. However, I am excited to keep improving and expanding my skills with each new project.  

## ðŸ”¨ Built With
- **Unity:** Game Engine used for development.  
- **C#:** Programming language used for scripting.  

## ðŸš€ Future Plans
I plan to improve this game over time as I learn more about mobile game development. I also hope that my future projects will be more polished and feature-rich as my skills continue to grow!  

## ðŸ“£ Feedback
Any feedback or suggestions are more than welcome! This is a learning journey, and I'm excited to hear your thoughts.
